The ABI program is especially interested in the development of informatics tools and resources that have the potential to advance- or transform- research in biology supported by the Directorate for Biological Sciences at the National Science Foundation.  The ABI program accepts three major types of proposals: Innovation awards that seek to pioneer new approaches to the application of informatics to biological problems, Development awards that seek to provide robust cyberinfrastructure that will enable transformative biological research, and Sustaining awards that seek to support ongoing operations and maintenance of existing cyberinfrastructure that is critical for continued advancement of priority biological research.">Hover to see abstract</td>

The Innovative Molecular Analysis Technologies (IMAT) program supports highly innovative, data-generating platforms and methodologies while the Informatics Technologies for Cancer Research (ITCR) program supports powerful data processing and visualization technologies. 
      To accelerate the development of new enabling cancer technologies, the NCI invites requests for supplemental funding in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 to support and encourage new multidisciplinary scientific collaborations among awardees from these two programs. The goal of the Activities to Promote Technology Research Collaborations (APTRC) is to support new collaborations that bring together complementary technology platforms and methodologies to enhance the capabilities of either in a way that advances cancer research or clinical care. The proposed APTRC activities must be within the overall scope of active parent grants.">Hover to see abstract</td>

      The program aims to: 
      - Increase public awareness and understanding of internet policy issues 
      - Support and enable career paths in the internet policy and advocacy sectors 
      - Celebrate and nurture a vibrant network of internet advocacy organizations 

      Fellows are makers and doers passionate about the open internet. They may bring specialities in data visualization, design, development, storytelling, research or policy analysis. While they may not have previous experience with internet advocacy, policy or activism, they are comfortable performing as technologists, experimenters and curious contributors to the open internet movement.">Hover to see abstract</td>
