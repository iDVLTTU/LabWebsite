				<a href="http://www.vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2018"> The Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Challenge </a> is an annual contest with the goal of advancing the field of visual analytics through competition. The VAST Challenge is designed to help researchers understand how their software would be used in a novel analytic task and determine if their data transformations, visualizations, and interactions would be beneficial for particular analytic tasks. VAST Challenge problems provide researchers with realistic tasks and data sets for evaluating their software, as well as an opportunity to advance the field by solving more complex problems.

				<center><h2>RA Proposal for Big Data Visualization in Water Resources</h2></center>
				According to the National Ground Water Association report in 2016, we extract around 982 km<sup>3</sup> of water per year from the ground. Therefore, monitoring ground water, sustaining aquifer capability, and analyzing its changes are highly desirable by decision makers. This proposal requests for one RA to work on big data visualization in water resources.
				This research is an on-going collaboration between the department of <a href="http://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/">Computer Science</a> and <a href="http://www.depts.ttu.edu/waterresources/"> Water Resources Center</a> in the department of <a href="http://www.depts.ttu.edu/ceweb/"> Civil Engineering</a>.

				<p>With this support, the student is aimed to target both research domains (water and big data visualization) in the College strategic growth initiative .</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In the first phase, the student will focus on developing visual analytics platforms to capture the trends/patterns, and to support analyzing the water usages in the Southern High Plains Aquifer of Texas.</li>
					<li>In the second phase, he will build virtual simulations that support risk analyses and disaster evacuation.</li>

			<h3>STOAViz: Visualizing Saturated Thickness of Ogallala Aquifer</h3>

				Computer Science and Civil, Environmental, and Construction Department, Texas Tech University, Texas, USA</h6>

			<b>ABSTRACT</b>
			<br/>
			In this paper, we introduce STOAViz, a visual analytics tool for analyzing the saturated thickness of the Ogallala aquifer.The saturated thicknesses are monitored by sensors integrated on wells distributed on a vast geographic area. Our analytics application also captures the trends and patterns (such as average/standard deviation over time, sudden increase/decrease of saturated thicknesses) of water on individual well and group of wells based on their geographic locations. To highlight the usefulness and effectiveness of STOAViz, we demonstrate it on the Southern High Plains Aquifer of Texas. The work was developed using feedback from experts at the water resource center at a university. Moreover, our technique can be applied on any geographic areas where wells and their measurements are available.

	<h3>CancerMapper: Overview Explorations<br/><br/>of Cancer Study Interaction Network</h3>

	<h6>Vinh The Nguyen and Tommy Dang<br/>
	Computer Science Department, Texas Tech University, Texas, USA</h6>

	<b>ABSTRACT</b>
	<br/>
	Understanding the complicated many-to-many relationships between cancers and mutated genes is challenging. For example, what common proteins are highly mutated in both prostate cancer and breast cancer or what cancers are driven by a selected subset of proteins. In this paper, we present CancerMapper, a novel exploration tool, that allows users to uncover the correlations among cancer studies as well as cancer studies and genes. CancerMapper also helps biologists to filter the cancer network based on the common mutated proteins and their frequencies. Bubble graph is constructed to visualize common protein based on its frequency and biological assemblies. Parallel coordinates highlight patterns of patient profiles (obtained from cBioportal by WebAPI services) on different attributes for a specified cancer study. Data retrieved from cBioportal.org as a Comma Separated Value file including protein name, frequency, cancer study and study type fields as well as Tab Separated Value through WebAPI service provided by cBioPortal. Protein’s images pulled from Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/)

	<h3>Ogallala Aquifer Monitoring Visualization</h3>

	<h6>Long Hoang Nuyen and Tommy Dang<br/>
	Computer Science Department, Texas Tech University, Texas, USA</h6>

	<b>ABSTRACT</b>
	<br/>
		Water is the basic element that humanity is reliant upon for everyday and production
	activities. According to the National Ground Water Association report in 2016 [Facts about global
	groundwater usage], we extract almost 982km3/year from the ground. This number serves as a
	good indicator of need of water in our daily life. Therefore, monitoring ground water, sustaining
	aquifer supply capability, and analyzing its changes are highly desirable by decision makers. In
	facts, a lot of wells that have integrated sensors to monitor water level information are established.
	As the number of wells increases, it becomes more and more challenging for specialists to
	visualize and analyze such large amount of data which come in realtime. The traditional processing
	method like Excel becomes out of capability. Thus, this becomes a burden to analysts.
	<br/><br/>
	The result and main contribution of this poster is a visual analytics tool that can handle such
	big sensor data and features various important dimensions for ground water analyst to quickly
	capture interesting water behavior such as its saturated thickness contour, time series data
	visualization. This tool also stretches out unusual pattern of water level such as sudden increase,
	sudden decrease points over time. It also compares water capability across different locations,
	regions and overall average along Ogallala aquifer.
